 * Backlog as of 11/13/2020:
 *
 * - Include a thing that says “yes” you gotta evaluate yourself
 * - Switch the ABC grade to percentages, so let students choose ABC etc but
 * then map it to 100, 97 etc so the mean can be calculated easily and I can
 * use that easily in my grading sheets
 * - Change the nubmering of the extra questions to be exclusive of the last
 * value. This way the user can use no extra questions
